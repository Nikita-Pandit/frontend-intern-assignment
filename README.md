# Run backend:
- npm run dev
- Backend will run at: http://localhost:5000

## 2️⃣ Frontend Setup

cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Frontend will run at: http://localhost:5173

## 4️⃣ Testing APIs with Postman

Import the collection from /postman/assignment-collection.json into Postman

Endpoints included:

POST /api/auth/register → Register new user

POST /api/auth/login → Login & get JWT token

GET /api/auth/profile → Get user profile (requires token)

GET /api/tasks → Fetch tasks

POST /api/tasks → Add task

PUT /api/tasks/:id → Update task

DELETE /api/tasks/:id → Delete task

Use Bearer Token in headers for protected routes.


## 📸 Logs & Screenshots

Check /logs folder for screenshots and API logs showing functionality.

## 📈 Scalability Notes

Frontend:

Modular React components

Context API for auth (can scale to Redux/Next.js for large projects)

Responsive UI ensures mobile-first scalability

Backend:

MVC folder structure (controllers, models, routes, middleware)

JWT middleware for secured routes

Can scale with Docker, Nginx load balancing, and cloud deployment (AWS/Heroku/Vercel)

Database can be extended to Postgres/MySQL if needed

✅ Just copy this into your `README.md` file and push it.  
Would you like me to also create a **demo section with screenshots/GIFs** (like Register → Login → Dashboard → CRUD) in the README so that recruiters can see the UI without even running your project?
